# AmaFind
AmaFind is a web scraper application that is built in Python using Selenium, BeautifulSoup4, and Pandas that captures item search results data from www.amazon.ca. The program allows for custom search input from the user to scrape all product information available on Amazon and exports it to a CSV file. Pandas DataFrames is used to sort the product information and provide key information for users in an easy-to-read format. Web scrapping has the potential to disrupt website services and as such, ethical practices were kept in mind throughout the process.
